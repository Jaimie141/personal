            Hello, world! My name is Jaimie. I am 30 years old, and for the past
            4 - 5 years I have been living in China and teaching English to
            kindergarten aged students. I love my job, and my life in China. But
            I don't see either as a permanent situation. So! I decided to teach
            myself to code in the hopes of changing careers when I move back to
            Scotland in the near future. At this point in time, I have been
            working on learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass and Bootstrap. I've
            used a whole combination of courses and resources. My plan is to
            join the CodeClan bootcamp for Software Development when I return to
            Scotland, but in the meantime I will try my best to learn what I can
            on my own while blogging about it all here.

          <h4>My Experience Of The 100 Days Of Code Twitter Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            When I first decided to start using my spare time to learn how to
            code, I was completely unaware of the wide array of topics and paths
            I could follow. I didn’t know what I was doing, or where I should
            begin.

              </h3>
              <p class="modal-content">
                When I first decided to start using my spare time to learn how
                to code, I was completely unaware of the wide array of topics
                and paths I could follow. I didn’t know what I was doing, or
                where I should begin. </br></br>I did a quick Google search and decided to
                start with Python, for no other reason than the name stuck out
                to me. I didn’t know what I could or couldn’t do with Python, or
                why it would be useful to me. But I jumped in anyway. As you can
                imagine, it didn’t take long for me to be overwhelmed and
                confused.</br></br>I was new to Twitter at the time, and after searching
                for the hashtag ‘#Python’ I then stumbled across #100DaysOfCode.
                It was a really exciting find for me. Not only did I learn a lot
                that day about the power of Twitter, I had also stumbled across
                an entire community of people in a similar situation to me, as
                well as lots of very experienced and super helpful people like
                Brad Traversy & Wes Bos (and the rest!). </br></br>After reading through
                hundreds of tweets with this hashtag, I was able to find
                multiple resources and more suitable starting points (turns out,
                HTML is a much easier and more suitable place to start!) </br></br>I
                jumped in and began tweeting everyday. I learned HTML & CSS
                through multiple resources (SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp,
                CodeAcademy, Udemy Courses, and lots of YouTube tutorials). I
                followed a lot of people who were posting regular #100DaysOfCode
                updates and kept track of where they were at, and compared my
                own journey to theirs. </br></br>I moved on to learning Javascript and
                continued posting everyday. </br></br>Around 1 month in, I started to feel
                pressured by the hashtag. I found myself starting to focus more
                on making sure I had an interesting project to post about than
                actually learning as much as I could from every project. At that
                point I realised it was becoming detrimental for me, so I
                decided to take a break from posting and continued studying on
                my own. In fact, I deleted my Twitter entirely at that point. I
                believe it was around day 35. </br></br>A couple of months later, I felt
                more confident and attempted to restart my #100DaysOfCode with a
                new Twitter account. I found some of the same people I’d been
                communicating with the first time round and tried to rebuild my
                little community. It was around this time that the Corona Virus
                took hold in China, and my life was essentially turned upside
                down. I struggled with focus and motivation for a while, and
                missed quite a lot of my daily posts. </br></br>I felt a little
                embarrassed to start posting again from where I left off, and
                was reluctant to restart it again for the 3rd time! So, I’m now
                taking a new approach. </br></br>I study and code everyday for at least an
                hour, but usually more if I can. At the end of each day I write
                a diary entry on Evernote, similar to what I would have posted
                on Twitter, but for only my eyes. I feel I can be more real this
                way, and I don’t feel the pressure of making sure I’m doing
                something that will get likes. </br></br>I still visit Twitter and read
                what everyone else is up to, but I’m not currently contributing
                - I’m taking a much more private and personal route for now, but
                still hope (and plan) to start making posts again in the near
                future.
